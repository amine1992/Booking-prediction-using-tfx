# Booking-prediction-using-tfx

## Overview
* In this project, the main task is to build an ML pipeline to solve the task of predicting the number of reservations made per hotel.
* Only a sample of the used data is included.
* The pipeline is mainly using the tensorflow extended libraries.
* For each step of the pipeline, we'll try to provide a notebook and a production code.
